    <p>
      Children living with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy disease belongs a group of hereditory progressive muscle
      disorder,in which the muscle fibers are slowly breaking down and are replaced by tissues and fat.
      Dead cells are eaten up by macrophages, a type of white blood cell and new muscle fibers are formed.The fibers breaking
      down leads to muscle weakeness and it occurs in four to six people per 100,000 births. <br>
      Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy was name in 1852 by the English Pyhsician Edward Meyron.
      It had proven that it is lack of the protein dystrophin is one major reasons to muscular dystrophy, and about
      forty genes control the various forms of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. <br>

      Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy is not a common disease, only one parent needs to pass on the non-functioning gene to affect the child and
      this is called autosomal dominant inheritance. For over the years now, this disease has been described as historic
      Muscular dystrophies which has been in existence.
      The most common muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which was first described in 1850 by the French
      neurologist Guillaume Duchenne, followed by Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy was was named in 1852 by the an English
      physician called Edward Meyron.
      The Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy was divided into different forms by an English neurologist. In 1987 it was
      obvious that it is lack of protein dystrophin that caused Duchenne muscular dystrophy which later caused a
      division into several muscular dystrophies says by Christopher Lindberg. <br>
      One major symptoms like pelvic muscle weakness, makes the child difficult in running, climbing stairs, standing for long or walk more than 5 minutes and
      the signs of this weakness starts from childhood to adolescent age and only gets worst thereafter as they age.. <br>
      The appearance of the child progressively changes as the muscles are growing weaker and deforming, which makes it
      very obvious when seeing the shoulder of the child, lower leg, and the child’s positioning while standing and so on. <br>
