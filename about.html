      <h3>Our Perspective</h3>
<p>
        We have been very active in watching over children living with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy disease for the
        past years,
        and we are glad to see the outcome of these children living with this disease to be very happy and positive in
        life. Our endeavors to see these children happy has brought joy to our heart.


        In general, want to make life easier for everyone who lives with a Limb-Girdle diagnosis and to have equal
        rights and opportunities in everyday activities as others who are healthy.
