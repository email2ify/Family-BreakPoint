                <h3>Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy</h3> 
                <p>
                    Children living with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy disease belongs a group of hereditory progressive muscle disorder,in which the muscle fibers are slowly breaks down 
                    and are replaced by tissues and fat.
                    Dead cells are eaten up by macrophages, a type of white blood cell and new muscle fibers are formed.The breaking down leads to muscle weakeness.Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy occurs in four to six people per 100,000 births.
                    Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy was name in 1852 by the English Pyhsician Edward Meyron. 
                    It had proven that it is lack of the protein dystrophin is one major reasons to muscular dystrophy, and about forty genes control the various forms of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, says Christopher Lindberg.
